== Project Background
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate a REST service built on Spring Boot 2 that works with an Angular
5 front end.

Some of my goals in this project were to:

. Create an organized and scalable project structure for Spring Boot application and an Angular CLI application
. Have a clear developer workflow
. Have a clear path to production
. Has web security consisting of a form login, JSON Web Token, and user roles
. Back end unit testing with the ability to separate unit tests from longer running integration tests during the build process.
. Front end unit testing (In progress)

== Technologies and Frameworks
* Spring Boot 2.0
* Angular 5/Angular CLI
* JUnit 4 (Hope is to upgrade to JUnit 5 and explore those changes)
* Maven 3+
* H2 in memory database (This easily be swapped out for another datasource)
* Spring JDBC for database queries (This too could be swapped our for another Java database technology)

== Required Software
* Java 8
* Maven 3+ (version 3.5 was used)
* Node.js for Angular CLI and front end dependency management
* Parent POM project https://github.com/pcalouche/spring-boot-project-pom[spring-boot-project-pom]

== How to Run
IMPORTANT: It is assumed that the required software is installed

. Download the https://github.com/pcalouche/spring-boot-project-pom[spring-boot-project-pom] project
. Download the https://github.com/pcalouche/spat[SPAT] project
. Install the spring-boot-project-pom project
+
From inside the install directory:

  mvn clean install

. Install the SPAT project
From inside the install directory:
+
  mvn clean install

. Run the REST services executable jar.  This runs at http://localhost:10000/spat/rest-services
+
  cd <spat_directory>/rest-services/target
  java -jar rest-services.jar

. Run the UI executable jar
+
  cd <spat_directory>/ui/target
  java -jar ui.jar

. Verify UI is running at http://localhost:10001/spat/ui and login works.  Valid users are:
 .. activeUser/password
 .. activeAdmin/password
+
